keyStream
=========

keyStream is an open source media server under the GNU GPL license. keyStream allows you to share your favorite videos with any computer and device on your network.

Features
=========

- Admin interface that allows you to manage categories, genres, videos, and default rating.
- Able to set a default rating that limits standard users access to ratings above the default. To view all videos no matter the rating you can login as an admin.
- Compatiable with all computers, PCs, tabets, and mobile devices that support HTML5.
- Custom categories and genres under the categories.
- Easily upload large video files by copying to uploads folder.

Uploading
=========

There are two options to upload your videos. 

For large files (Over 200 MB) you simply place your video into the uploads folder. You will then need to login to the admin dashboard where it will prompt you to upload the files. Once uploaded you can see them in your video area.

For smaller uploads you can use the Quick Uploader in the admin dashboard.

To do
=========

keyStream is now under very early release. There are still things that need to be completed.

- Default image when there is none uploaded.
- Restrict file types to videos with upload folder uploader.
- Enhance UX.
- Add version info xml.
