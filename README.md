Uploading
=========

There are two options to upload your videos. 

For large files (Over 200 MB) you simply place your video into the uploads folder. You will then need to login to the admin dashboard where it will prompt you to upload the files. Once uploaded you can see them in your video area.

For smaller uploads you can use the Quick Uploader in the admin dashboard.
